# VoiceRecorder
This python project illustrates how to generate recoring of the voice recorded.

sounddevice - Python module provides bindings for the PortAudio library and a few convenience functions to play and record NumPy arrays containing audio signals.

SciPy has many modules, classes, and functions available to read data from and write data to a variety of file formats.

Sampling rate or sampling frequency defines the number of samples per second (or per other unit) taken from a continuous signal to make a discrete or digital signal.

Channel parameter in sounddevice.rec() indicates Number of channels to record.
